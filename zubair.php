		<ul>
    	<li> I am currently a junior, anticipated to graduate in May, 2019. I started off my first year in college majoring in Economics. </li>
			<li> I'm involved in some extra-curricular activities such as Alpha Kappa Psi, the professional business fraternity; and Grass Roots Soccer, a health organization that uses the power of soccer to educate, inspire, and mobilize young people to lead healthier lives. </li>
			<li> These two organizations have helped me develop so much as a student, where Alpha Kappa Psi has helped me develop my professional skills tremendously, and Grass Roots Soccer has given me a great opportunity to give back to the community. </li>
			<li> I enjoy painting in my free time. I took up painting a few years ago, teaching myself different painting techniques on various mediums. I mostly do nature scenes and landscapes. Attempting these types of paintings tend to help relax and find solace in the quiet and solidarity I find while painting. </li>
			<li> However, when I’m looking for a change of pace, I usually go play basketball. It’s one of the few sports that I find very enjoyable, not just to watch, but also play. I started playing basketball in middle school, and have enjoyed playing it ever since. </li>

		<h3>Work Experience</h3>

Here, I assist with network registration and troubleshoot network issues, troubleshoot NetID and login issues, provide support through various methods,assist with various types of malware on students' personal computers. </li>
			<li> Other than that, last summer I had the chance to work for Media Prima Digital, a multimedia company based in Malaysia.

I was also trained in both front end and back end systems for web development. </li>
